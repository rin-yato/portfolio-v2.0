Have you ever wanted to contribute to open source but didn't know
where to start? In this article, we'll go over the basics of how
to get started with contributing to open source projects.

## My assumptions

I'm assuming that you have some basic knowledge of programming and
that you know how to use Git. If not, there are plenty of resources
online that can help you learn these skills.

I'm also assuming that you know what open source is and why it's
important. In this article, we'll be focusing on the `HOW`.

## 1. Pick a project that interests you

The first step is to find a project that interests you. There are
many different types of projects out there, so it's important to
find one that you're passionate about.

Also make sure that the project is active and has a good community
around it. You don't want to spend time contributing to a project
that no one cares about.

Here are some tips for finding projects:

- It's a topic you're interested in
- It uses technologies you're familiar with
- It has a good community around it
- It's active and has recent commits

In this example, we'll be using
[QueryMaster](https://github.com/invisal/query-master)
project as our example project. It is a database management
tool for SQL.

## 2. Read the contribution guidelines

Once you've found a project that interests you, **_MAKE SURE_** you
read their guidelines if they have any. This will help you avoid
wasting time on things that aren't allowed or won't be accepted.

## 3. Find an issue to work on

Now that you've found a project that interests you and read their
guidelines, it's time to find an issue to work on. This is where
most people get stuck because they don't know how to find issues
that are good for beginners.

Here are some tips for finding issues:

- Look for issues that are labeled `good first issue` or `beginner  friendly`
- Look for issues that are labeled `help wanted` or `help needed`
- Look for issues that are labeled `easy` or `low hanging fruit`
- Look for issues that you have experience with
- Or just ask the maintainers for suggestions

This is an example of a good first issue from QueryMaster. It's
labeled `good first issue` and has a description of what needs to
be done. It also has a simple guide of how this issue can be
solved and where to start.

But sadly, Bong Visal already said that he will work on this issue. üòÇ

## 4. Fork the repository

Once you've found an issue to work on, it's time to fork the
repository. This will create a copy of the project in your own
account so that you can make changes without affecting the original
project.

To fork a repository, click on the `Fork` button in the top right
corner of the repository page.

## 5. Clone the repository

Now that you've forked the repository, it's time to clone it to
your local machine. This will allow you to make changes and test
them out before submitting a pull request.

Make sure you clone the repository from `your own account` and not
the original project!

## 6. Create a new branch

Once you've cloned the repository, it's time to create a new branch
for your changes. This will allow you to work on multiple issues at
the same time without affecting each other.

Some projects have specific naming conventions for branches,
so make sure you read their guidelines before creating a new branch.

To create a new branch, run the following command:

```bash
git checkout "branch-name"

# For example:
git checkout feat/context-menu
```

To switch to your new branch, run the following command:

```bash
git checkout "branch-name"

# For example:
git checkout feat/context-menu
```

## 7. Make your changes

Now that you've created a new branch, it's time to make your
changes. One thing you must not forget is that you can ask the
maintainers for help if you get stuck or have any questions.
Or if you just don't know where to start, you can ask them for help.

You can also refer to the guide that was posted with the issue for
more information on how to solve it.

## 8. Commit your changes

Once you've made your changes, it's time to commit them. This will
save your changes to your local repository so that you can push
them to GitHub later on.

Make sure you write a good and short commit message that explains
what you did and why you did it. This will help the maintainers
understand your changes and why they were made. This will make the
maintainers happy. üòÇ

To commit your changes, run the following command:

```bash
# Don't forget to add the
# files you want to commit
git add .

git commit -m "commit message"

# For example:
git commit -m "feat: added context menu"
```

## 9. Push your changes

How do I even explain this? üòÇ
Let's push the changes to the `FORKED` repository.

```bash
git push origin "branch-name"
```

## 10. Create a pull request

Now that you've pushed your changes to your forked repository, it's
time to create a pull request. This will allow the maintainers to
review your changes and merge them into the original project if
they're good enough.

Make sure you write a good and short description of your changes
and why they were made. This will help the maintainers understand
your changes and why they were made.

I know I said this before, but I'll say it again, because it's easier
to read the pull request description than to read the commit messages.üòÇ

To create a pull request, click on the `Compare & pull request`
button. It should look something like this

![Compare & pull request button](/blogs/open-source-guide/pull-request-button.png)

Now it will take you to the pull request page. Here you can write
a good and short description of your changes and why they were made.

## 11. Wait for feedback

Now that you've created a pull request, it's time to wait for
feedback. The maintainers will review your changes and give you
feedback on them. If they're good enough, they'll merge them into
the original project.

If they're not good enough, they'll give you feedback on how to
improve them. You can then make the necessary changes and push them
to the same branch. This will update your pull request with the
new changes.

## 12. Celebrate

Now that you've made your first contribution to an open source
project, You can now go and brag about it to your friends. üòÇ

## Conclusion

I hope this article helped you understand how to contribute to open
source projects. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free
to leave a comment in my facebook's post, since I don't have comment here. üòÇ Alrightyy, see you in the next article. Bye bye üëãüçÄ
